When creating your custom material:
- Materials that include drivers require care (e.g. Base Instance and Extra Instance materials)
- Copy an existing one and build upon it
- or check out how it controls the color of the instances and copy that part to your material
- For a material to show up in the "Project Settings" panel include one or more keywords at the end of it's name:
